# Hi! My name is Qadis Chaudhry. <br>
Currently working in toward a degree in electrical and computer engineering, at the Rutgers School of Engineering. <br>
This repository consists of a multitude of side projects that I have worked on over the years, and with a knack <br>
for the unknown, there is little that seperates imagination and curiosity, from the will of the developer.
