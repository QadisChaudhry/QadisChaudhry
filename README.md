# Hi there!! <br>
Currently working in toward a degree in electrical and computer engineering, at the Rutgers School of Engineering. This repository consists of a multitude of side projects that I have worked on over the years, and with a passion for theoretical as well as practical application, constant curiosity instantiates a life long pursuit of knowledge, not only in the world of today, but of the future as well.
